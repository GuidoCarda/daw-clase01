        <h2 id="1-react-compiler">1- React Compiler</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, React doesn't automatically re-render on state change. A
          way to optimise these re-renders is to manually use useMemo(),
          useCallback(), and memo APIs. As per React's team, this was a
          "reasonable manual compromise". Their vision was to let React manage
          these re-renders.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the React team realized that manual optimisation is cumbersome,
          and the feedback from the community encouraged them to solve this
          issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the React Team has created the "React compiler". The React
          compiler will now manage these re-renders. React will decide
          automatically how and when to change the state and update the UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this, we developers don't need to do this manually anymore. It
          also means no need to use useMemo(), useCallback(), and memo.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this will be released in an upcoming version of React, you can
          learn more about the compiler from these resources:
        </p>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/kjOacmVsLSE?si=dqCjg0_9x2hOB8BF"
          >React compiler video</a
        >
        <p>
          React will decide which components to optimise and when, along with
          what to re-render.
        </p>

        <h2 id="#2-server-components">2- Server components</h2>
        <p>
          If you haven't heard about server components yet, you're missing out
          on one of the most exciting developments in React and Next.js.
        </p>

        <p>
          Up until now, React components have primarily run on the client side.
          But React is introducing the groundbreaking concept of running
          components on the server side.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idea of server components has been circulating for years, with
          Next.js being the pioneer in implementing them for production.
          Starting from Next.js 13, all components are server components by
          default. To make a component run on the client side, you need to use
          the "use client" directive.
        </p>

        <p>
          In React 19, server components will be integrated directly into React,
          bringing a host of advantages:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>SEO:</strong> Server-rendered components enhance search
            engine optimisation by providing more accessible content to web
            crawlers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance Boost:</strong> Server components contribute to
            faster initial page loads and improved overall performance,
            particularly for content-heavy applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Server-Side Execution:</strong> Server components enable
            executing code on the server, making tasks like API calls seamless
            and efficient.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These advantages underscore the transformative potential of server
          components in modern web development.
        </p>

        <h2 id="3-actions">3- Actions</h2>
        <p>
          In version 19, another exciting addition will be Actions. This is
          going to be a game-changer for how we work with forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actions will let you integrate actions with the HTML tag
          <code>&ltform /&gt</code>. In simpler terms, you'll be able to replace
          the <code>onSubmit</code> event with Actions. These actions are HTML
          form attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the introduction of server components, Actions can be executed on
          the server side. In our JSX, with <code>&ltform/&gt</code>, we can
          drop the onSubmit event and use the action attribute. The value of the
          action attribute will be a method to submit the data either on the
          client or server side.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can execute both synchronous and asynchronous operations with
          actions, streamlining data submission management and state updates.
          The goal is to make the working with forms and handling data easier.
        </p>

        <p>Let's look at an example to see how this works:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          "use server"

          const submitData = async (userData) => {
              const newUser = {
                  username: userData.get('username'),
                  email: userData.get('email')
              }
              console.log(newUser)
          }
         </code>
        </pre>
        <pre>
          <code>
            const Form = () =&gt; {
              return &lt;form action={submitData}&gt;
                  &lt;div&gt;
                      &lt;label&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
                      &lt;input type="text" name='username'/&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div&gt;
                      &lt;label&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
                      &lt;input type="text" name="email" /&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;button type='submit'&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
              &lt;/form&gt;
         </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          In the above code, submitData is the action in the server component.
          form is a client side component which is using the submitData as
          action. submitData will be execute on the server. The communication of
          the client (form), and server (submitData) components is only possible
          because of the action attribute.
        </p>

        <h2 id="4-web-components">4- Web components</h2>

        <p>
          Web components allow you to create custom components using native
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, seamlessly incorporating them into your web
          applications as if they were standard HTML tags. Pretty amazing,
          right?
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, integrating web components into React isn't
          straightforward. Typically, you either need to convert the web
          component to a React component or install extra packages and write
          additional code to make web components work with React. This can be
          frustrating.
        </p>

        <p>
          Luckily, React 19 will help you integrate web components into your
          React code much more easily. If you come across a really useful web
          component, such as a carousel, you can seamlessly incorporate it into
          your React projects without the need to convert it into React code.
        </p>

        <p>
          This streamlines development and allows you to leverage the vast
          ecosystem of existing web components in your React applications.
        </p>

        <h2 id="5-document-metadata">5- Document metadata</h2>
        <p>
          Elements like "title," "meta tags," and "description" are crucial in
          optimising SEO and ensuring accessibility. In React, where single-page
          applications are prevalent, managing these elements across different
          routes can be a bit of a hassle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, developers often resort to writing custom code, or using
          packages like react-helmet to handle route changes and update metadata
          accordingly. This process can be repetitive and error-prone,
          especially when dealing with SEO-sensitive elements like meta tags.
        </p>

        <p>
          With React19, we can use the title and meta tags directly in our React
          components:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
            Const HomePage = () =&gt; {
              return (
                &lt;&gt;
                  &lt;title&gt;Freecodecamp&lt;/title&gt;
                  &lt;meta name="description" content="Freecode camp blogs" /&gt;
                  // Page content
                &lt;/&gt;
              );
            }
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 id="6-asset-loading">6-Asset Loading</h2>

        <p>
          In React, you'll need to carefully manage the loading experience and
          performance of your applications, particularly with images and other
          asset files.
        </p>

        <p>
          Often, the view renders first in the browser, followed by stylesheets,
          fonts, and images. This can result in a flicker from non-styled (or
          flash of unstyled content) to a styled view.
        </p>

        <p>
          To mitigate this issue, developers often resort to adding custom code
          to detect when these assets are ready, ensuring that the view is
          displayed only after everything has loaded.
        </p>

        <p>
          In React 19, images and other files will load in the background as
          users explore the current page. This improvement should help improve
          page load times and reduce waiting periods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, React is introducing lifecycle Suspense for assets loading,
          including scripts, stylesheets, and fonts. This feature enables React
          to determine when the content is ready to be displayed, eliminating
          any "unstyled" flickering.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are new Resource Loading APIs like preload and preinit to
          provide greater control for when a resource should load and
          initialise.
        </p>

        <p>
          By allowing assets to load asynchronously in the background, React 19
          minimizes waiting times and ensures that users can interact with the
          conatent without interruptions. This optimization not only enhances
          the performance of React applications but also contributes to a more
          enjoyable browsing experience for users.
        </p>

        <h2 id="7-new-react-hooks">7- New React Hooks</h2>

        <h3>The new <code>use()</code> hook</h3>
        <p>
          React19 will introduce a new hook called use(). This hook will
          simplify how we use promises, async code, and context.
        </p>

        <h3>The <code>useFormStatus()</code> hook</h3>
        <p>
          This new hook in React19 will help you have more control over the
          forms you create. It will give you status information about the last
          form submission.
        </p>

        <h3>The <code>useFormState()</code> hook</h3>
        <p>
          Another new hook in React19 is useFormState. It allows you to update
          state based on the result of a form submission.
        </p>

        <h3>The <code>useOptimistic()</code> hook</h3>
        <p>
          useOptimistic is a React Hook that lets you show a different state
          while an async action is underway, according to the React docs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This hook will help enhance the user experience and should result in
          faster responses. This will be useful for applications that need to
          interact with the server.
        </p>
